# Basic Calculator

A simple calculator application developed for practicing different coding approaches through pull requests. This repository demonstrates various implementations of a basic calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that are used solely for learning and experimentation. **Note:** The pull requests in this repository are for practice purposes only and will not be merged into the main branch.
